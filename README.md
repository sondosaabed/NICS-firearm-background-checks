## Investigation process
In this report, a data analysis process is conducted on the NICS and Census Datasets. The process is performed in a structured manner where two main questions are considered: what is the,,, why is the,,. In order to investigate and answer these questions: first of all the data is loaded into pandas dataframes, then an intial exploration is conducted, the next phase was assessing the data quality: that included multiple aspects such as: Detection of missing values, detection of duplicated values, detection of outliers and fiannly inconsistentny between the datsets. Now that the assessment is done, the datasets go through a cleaning process based on the assessment done, including handling the following: missing values, duplicated values, outliers and merging the datasets with fixing any inconsistentcies. Then, the exploratory data analysis (EDA) is done in order to answer the questions proposed, where that included visualizations too. Finally, the conclusions are made and presented to the reader and teh report is extracted into an html document.
